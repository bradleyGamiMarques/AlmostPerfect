# AlmostPerfect
Solution to the Almost Perfect Program problem in Comp 349 Applied Algorithms

# Statement of the problem

Write a C++ program to determine if a given number is semiperfect. Do this in under 60 seconds.
The full test case are the numbers 1 - 10000.

# Input File (semiperfect.in)

The input file contains multiple test cases. Each test case, one per line, contains a single positive integer, n, (0 < n ≤ 10000).
A line that contains a single zero indicates the end of the file. There are no spaces or blank lines in the input file

# Output File (semiperfect.out)

There should be one line of output for each test case. For each input integer (other than the final zero) output the integer
followed by a colon (‘:’), followed by “YES” if the integer is semiperfect and “NO” otherwise. All letters should be capital
letters, and there should be no spaces or blank lines in the output.
